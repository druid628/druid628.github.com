Here, I shall post projects that I'm working on that I want to share with the world. I won't lie, I'm stingy with my a lot of my code. Some projects are written for my company <a href="https://github.com/blueshamrockdev">Blue Shamrock Development</a>, some are written just for fun, while others are written  to be shared. 

The following projects which are available or will be available on gitHub:
<UL>
<LI><A class="project" HREF="https://github.com/druid628/OddsThomas">OddsThomas</A> - An online (faux) betting system. Currently incomplete mainly needs access to a feed which supplies odds (as well as a few other little pieces)</LI>
